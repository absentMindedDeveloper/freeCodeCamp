The distance formula is a mathematical equation used to calculate the distance between two points using their x and y coordinates.

Suppose the first point is located at (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and the second at (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>).
You would then procede to input each number into the equation above to calculate the distance.

Now this formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states: a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.

The distance is simply the hypotenuse of the right triangle created by the two points. And by rearranging the equation you get: d<sup>2</sup> = (x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>. With (x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>) and (y<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) being the length of the two legs of the triangle.
